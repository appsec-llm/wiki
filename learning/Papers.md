### Short Description

A first(?) paper that has proposed a transformer architecture for neural networks. While it's initial purpose was much smaller, the effect seems to have surpassed actual authors' imagination. For us, the value is more historical, as the architecture has [undergone some changes since then](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/why-the-original-transformer-figure).
